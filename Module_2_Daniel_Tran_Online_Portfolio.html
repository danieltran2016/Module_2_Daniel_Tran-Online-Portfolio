   <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p> I am Daniel Tran, i have always had a natrual curiousity for how things work. I 
        started out with toys, taking apart RC cars and playing with Lincoln Logs. I moved 
        onto Erector sets and Nitro RC cars. In high school, I began working on cars fixing 
        my car and woodworking. I learned how to do everything online to understand how 
        things work. I went to college and graduated with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering. 
        While in school, I got into motorcycles, working on them, modifiying and building 
        them. Mechanical systems came naturally to me.

    <h2 id="Programming">Why Programming?</h2>
    <p>I tried taking a computer science elective in high school, the teacher was horrible
        and left me with a bad intro experience. I had an amazing physics teacher, so I did 
        Mechanical Engineering. After graduating and working as the head engineer at a 
        local San Antonio motorcycle companyfor 3 years, I began to understand the value 
        and importance of computer literacy. I saw the potential for automation, expansion, 
        simplicity and complexity (at the same time), of being able to get computers to help with labor.

    <h2 id="Project_1">Project 1: Semantic tags and Accessibility</h2>
    <p> I converted all of the div tags to semantic tags. This allows users and co authors to more easily
        understand the organization of the code. Semantic tags are more helpful in debugging and modifying 
        code because the logic of the page can be more easily understood and targeted. They help to convery 
        the meaning of the content.
