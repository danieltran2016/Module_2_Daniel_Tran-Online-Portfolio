   <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p> I am Daniel Tran, i have always had a natrual curiousity for how things work. I 
        started out with toys, taking apart RC cars and playing with Lincoln Logs. I moved 
        onto Erector sets and Nitro RC cars. In high school, I began working on cars fixing 
        my car and woodworking. I learned how to do everything online to understand how 
        things work. I went to college and graduated with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering. 
        While in school, I got into motorcycles, working on them, modifiying and building 
        them. Mechanical systems came naturally to me.

    <h2 id="Programming">Why Programming?</h2>
    <p>I tried taking a computer science elective in high school, the teacher was horrible
        and left me with a bad intro experience. I had an amazing physics teacher, so I did 
        Mechanical Engineering. After graduating and working as the head engineer at a 
        local San Antonio motorcycle companyfor 3 years, I began to understand the value 
        and importance of computer literacy. I saw the potential for automation, expansion, 
        simplicity and complexity (at the same time), of being able to get computers to help with labor.

    <h2 id="Project_1">Project 1: Semantic tags and Accessibility</h2>
    <p> I converted all of the div tags to semantic tags. This allows users and co authors to more easily
        understand the organization of the code. Semantic tags are more helpful in debugging and modifying 
        code because the logic of the page can be more easily understood and targeted. They help to convery 
        the meaning of the content.

    <p>I have created a website to host all of my works. It is updated as a live resume to show the work that
        I have completed and allow others to review. This page includes all of my online social contact 
        information as well as my resume. It was created completely from scratch using the basic HTML and CSS commands learned.
        The page will be an ever evolving work as I gain more tools in my personal skillset.

    <p> User Story: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>As a user I want to quickly look up some good chuck norris and dad jokes so that I can be funny. </li>
        <li>As a user I want to be able to see previous jokes at a glance in case I momentarily forget it. </li>
        <li>As a user I want to be able to clear it once the jokes have been used so that people think im original</li>
        </ul>
    <p>This program was developed during brainstorming of Project 1, we were told to do a stand-up when we met with one another. Therefore, we created a stand-up app from old school nostalgia. Nobody has heard a good Chuck Norris joke in years. Dad jokes, are never out of style. This app allows users to see some randomly generated jokes gathered from public API’s in one window. </p>
    <p>Technology used:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>CSS and Bulma for responsive layout</li>
        <li>Javascript and localstorage arrays</li>
        <li>Public API calls</li>

    <h2 id="future">Future potential projects </h2>
       <p><strong>Project Name: Dinner Picker</strong></p>            
    <p>This will be a program/javascript that my frineds, family and I can use to help decide what or where we want to eat/do when we cant
        figure out what we want to do. It can host a bunch of restaurants, types of food and places. You can set it to random or you can 
        bias it towards a certain category of food or entertainment you want to do. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>User story:</strong></p>
    <p>I want a page/app that I can enter restuarants, rank them on a scale of how much i like them. I want to be able to 
        choose random or targeted for a selector. I can hit random and a random restaurant will come up and help me choose where or what to 
        eat dinner or lunch. I want it to be able to target italian if that catetgory is selected etc. If possible I want it to save the selection
        for a given night and not repeat the selection based on a given interval. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance criteria:</strong></p>
    <p>A user can hit random and a choice will be selected.</p>
    <p>A user can select a category to narrow down the results</p>
    <P>A user can submit entries that will be saved for the choice database</P>
    <p>A user can rank/weigh the choices towards ones they like</p>
